# Recommendation System Project Using PySpark

## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase a comprehensive end-to-end implementation of a recommendation system using PySpark, web scraping, and machine learning. The aim is to develop a system capable of recommending products based on user preferences and behavior, leveraging the power of Big Data technologies. The project is structured to be efficient, scalable, and entirely based on free and open-source tools.

## Project Workflow

1. Environment Setup:

- Configuration of a Python development environment using Visual Studio Code.
- Installation of necessary packages including PySpark, BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

2. Data Collection:

- Web scraping to gather data from online sources.
- Cleaning and processing the collected data for analysis.

3. Data Processing with PySpark:

- Loading and processing large datasets using PySpark.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior and preferences.

4. Recommendation System Development:

- Implementation of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

5. Deployment and Visualization:

- Exporting the results and creating visualizations to present the recommendations.
- Optionally deploying the model using a simple web interface.

## Technologies Used

- PySpark: For handling and processing large datasets efficiently.
- Python: The main programming language used in this project.
- BeautifulSoup & requests: For web scraping and data collection.
- pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Project Goals

-Demonstrate the ability to build and deploy a recommendation system.
-Utilize Big Data tools to process and analyze large datasets.
-Showcase skills in web scraping, data processing, and machine learning.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the environment as described in the setup instructions.
3. Run the scripts to collect data, process it, and build the recommendation system.
4. Explore the results and visualize the recommendations.

## Future Work

- Enhancing the model with additional features and algorithms.
- Integrating a more sophisticated deployment strategy.
- Continuous optimization for performance improvements.
